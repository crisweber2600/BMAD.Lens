Before using lens-aware workflows, complete the initial setup:

SETUP CHECKLIST:
□ 1. Create TargetProjects/ directory
□ 2. Organize domain folders
□ 3. Clone Service repositories
□ 4. Configure LENS (_bmad/lens/config.yaml)
□ 5. Run discovery/indexing (if applicable)

RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS:
• Review onboarding workflow for guided setup

NAVIGATION CARD:
- Lens position: {current_lens}
- Phase: {current_phase}
- Active scope: {domain}/{service}/{microservice}/{feature}

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOWS:
{For each recommendation:}

  Priority: {priority}

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
• Run recommended workflow
• Switch lens (lens-switch)
• Load detailed context (context-load)
