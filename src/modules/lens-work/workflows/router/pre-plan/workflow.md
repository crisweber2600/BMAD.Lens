# /pre-plan — Analysis Phase Router

**Purpose:** Guide users through the Analysis phase, invoking brainstorming, research, and product brief workflows.

---

## Role Authorization

**Authorized:** PO, Architect, Tech Lead

```yaml
# Advisory check (logged, not blocking)
if user_role not in ["PO", "Architect", "Tech Lead"]:
  log_warning("Role ${user_role} typically doesn't initiate /pre-plan")
```

## User Interaction Keywords

This workflow supports special keywords to control prompting behavior:

- **"defaults" / "best defaults"** → Apply defaults to **CURRENT STEP ONLY**; resume normal prompting for subsequent steps
- **"yolo" / "keep rolling"** → Apply defaults to **ENTIRE REMAINING WORKFLOW**; auto-complete all steps
- **"all questions" / "batch questions"** → Present **ALL QUESTIONS UPFRONT** → wait for batch answers → follow-up questions → adversarial review → final questions → generate artifacts
- **"skip"** → Jump to a named optional step (e.g., "skip to product brief")
- **"pause"** → Halt workflow, save progress, resume later
- **"back"** → Roll back to previous step, re-answer questions

Full documentation: [User Interaction Keywords](../../docs/user-interaction-keywords.md)

**Critical Rule:** 
- "defaults" applies only to the current question/step
- "yolo" applies to all remaining steps in the workflow
- "all questions" presents comprehensive questionnaire, then iteratively refines with follow-ups and party mode review
- Other workflows and phases are unaffected

- [x] Layer detected with confidence ≥ 75%
- [x] state.yaml exists with active initiative
- [x] Initiative file exists at `_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/{id}.yaml`

## Execution Sequence

### 0. Git Discipline — Verify Clean State

```yaml
# Verify working directory is clean
invoke: casey.verify-clean-state

# Load two-file state
state = load("_bmad-output/lens-work/state.yaml")
initiative = load("_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/${state.active_initiative}.yaml")

# Read size from initiative config (shared, canonical)
size = initiative.size
domain_prefix = initiative.domain_prefix

# === Path Resolver (S01-S06: Context Enhancement) ===
docs_path = initiative.docs.path    # e.g., "docs/BMAD/LENS/BMAD.Lens/context-enhancement-9bfe4e"
repo_docs_path = "docs/${initiative.docs.domain}/${initiative.docs.service}/${initiative.docs.repo}"

if docs_path == null or docs_path == "":
  # Fallback for older initiatives without docs block
  docs_path = "_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/"
  repo_docs_path = null
  warning: "⚠️ DEPRECATED: Initiative missing docs.path configuration."
  warning: "  → Run: /compass migrate <initiative-id> to add docs.path"
  warning: "  → This fallback will be removed in a future version."

output_path = docs_path
ensure_directory(output_path)

# === Context Loader (S08: Context Enhancement) ===
# Pre-plan has no prior artifacts to load — this is the first phase
# repo_docs_path provides optional context from target repo
if repo_docs_path != null:
  repo_readme = load_if_exists("${repo_docs_path}/README.md")
  repo_contributing = load_if_exists("${repo_docs_path}/CONTRIBUTING.md")
  repo_context = { readme: repo_readme, contributing: repo_contributing }
else:
  repo_context = null

# Validate we're on the correct branch (or can switch)
# New branch pattern: {Domain}/{InitiativeId}/{size}-{phaseNumber}
expected_branch: "${domain_prefix}/${initiative.id}/${size}-1"
current_branch = casey.get-current-branch()

if current_branch != expected_branch:
  if branch_exists(expected_branch):
    invoke: casey.checkout-branch
    params:
      branch: ${expected_branch}
  # else: branch will be created in Step 2
```

### 1. Validate State & Constitution

```yaml
# Check active initiative
if state.active_initiative == null:
  error: "No active initiative. Run #new-domain, #new-service, or #new-feature first."

# Constitution enforcement — verify required fields
required_fields: [name, layer, target_repos]
for field in required_fields:
  if initiative.${field} == null or initiative.${field} == "":
    error: "Initiative missing required field: ${field}. Re-run #new-* to fix."

# Phase check
if initiative.current_phase not in [null, "p1"]:
  warning: "Current phase is ${initiative.current_phase}. /pre-plan is for Phase 1."
```

### 1a. Constitutional Context Injection (Required)

```yaml
# Resolve constitutional governance for the active initiative context
constitutional_context = invoke("scribe.resolve-context")

# Parse errors are hard failures because governance cannot be evaluated
if constitutional_context.status == "parse_error":
  error: |
    Constitutional context parse error:
    ${constitutional_context.error_details.file}
    ${constitutional_context.error_details.error}

# Make constitutional context available to downstream workflows
session.constitutional_context = constitutional_context
```

### 1b. Discovery Validation

```yaml
# Check that repo-discover has been run for target repos
for repo in initiative.target_repos:
  inventory_path = "_bmad-output/lens-work/repo-inventory.yaml"
  inventory = load(inventory_path)
  
  if repo not in inventory.repos:
    warning: |
      ⚠️ Discovery not run for repo: ${repo}
      Run @scout discover for better analysis context.
      Proceeding without discovery data.
```

### 1b. Constitution Compliance Gate (ADVISORY)

```yaml
# Invoke compliance-check to verify inherited constitution constraints
# Mode: ADVISORY (log warnings, do not block)
invoke: lens-work.compliance-check
params:
  phase: "p1"
  phase_name: "Analysis"
  initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
  target_repos: ${initiative.target_repos}
  mode: "ADVISORY"

# Compliance check logs findings to _bmad-output/lens-work/compliance-reports/
# Warnings are surfaced to user but do not block workflow progression
```

### 2. Start Phase (if needed)

```yaml
# Invoke Casey if small-1 branch doesn't exist — auto-branch creation
# Branch pattern: {Domain}/{InitiativeId}/{size}-{phaseNumber}
if not branch_exists("${domain_prefix}/${initiative.id}/${size}-1"):
  invoke: casey.start-phase
  params:
    phase_number: 1
    phase_name: "Analysis"
    initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
    size: ${size}
    domain_prefix: ${domain_prefix}
  # Casey creates: ${domain_prefix}/{initiative_id}/{size}-1 and pushes to remote

  # Pull latest after branch creation
  invoke: casey.pull-latest
```

### 2a. Batch Mode (Single-File Questions)

```yaml
if initiative.question_mode == "batch":
  invoke: lens-work.batch-process
  params:
    phase_number: "1"
    phase_name: "Analysis"
    template_path: "templates/phase-1-analysis-questions.template.md"
    output_filename: "phase-1-analysis-questions.md"
  exit: 0
```

### 3. Offer Workflow Options

```
