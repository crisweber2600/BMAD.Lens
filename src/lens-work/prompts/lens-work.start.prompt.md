# LENS Workbench System Preflight Check & Activation

Execute preflight check of all lens-work systems, then activate Compass for workflow guidance.

---

## Phase 0: Daily Sync Check (Optional)

### 0.1 Load User Profile
- [ ] Check for profile: `_bmad-output/personal/profile.yaml`
- [ ] Load last sync timestamp from `profile.lens_work.last_sync.date`
- [ ] Compare to today's date

### 0.2 Decide Sync Action
```
if profile.lens_work.last_sync.date == today:
  Already synced today
  Use cached branch selection from profile

else:
  First sync today
  [1] Run sync-and-select-branch workflow (recommended)
  [2] Skip and continue with cached selection
  [3] Skip sync entirely
```

### 0.3 If User Selects [1] Sync
- Invoke: `{project-root}/_bmad/lens-work/workflows/utility/sync-and-select-branch/workflow.md`
- Pass: active_initiative, target_repo from state
- Receive: selected_branch, commit_date, commit_hash
- Proceed to Core System Check with freshly selected branch

> **Note:** Profile-tracked sync runs at most once per day per user. Use `/sync-now` command in Compass to force immediate re-sync after first run.

## Step 1: Core System Check

### 1.1 Module Configuration
- [ ] Check for module config: `_bmad/lens-work/module.yaml`
- [ ] Check for Compass agent: `_bmad/lens-work/agents/compass.agent.yaml`
- [ ] Check for state directory: `_bmad-output/lens-work/`

### 1.2 Agent Roster
- [ ] Compass (Phase Router) — `agents/compass.agent.yaml`
- [ ] Casey (Git Conductor) — `agents/casey.agent.yaml`
- [ ] Tracey (State Manager) — `agents/tracey.agent.yaml`
- [ ] Scout (Bootstrap & Discovery) — `agents/scout.agent.yaml`
- [ ] Scribe (Constitutional Guardian) — `agents/scribe.agent.yaml`

### 1.3 Core Workflows (v2 named phases)
- [ ] `workflows/router/pre-plan/` — PrePlan phase (Mary/Analyst)
- [ ] `workflows/router/spec/` — BusinessPlan phase (John/PM + Sally/UX)
- [ ] `workflows/router/tech-plan/` — TechPlan phase (Winston/Architect)
- [ ] `workflows/router/plan/` — DevProposal phase (John/PM)
- [ ] `workflows/router/sprintplan/` — SprintPlan phase (Bob/SM)
- [ ] `workflows/router/dev/` — Implementation loop
- [ ] `workflows/core/audience-promotion/` — Audience promotion gates
- [ ] `workflows/discovery/repo-discover/` — Repo inventory
- [ ] `workflows/utility/bootstrap/` — Initial setup

## Step 2: State Check (Two-File Pattern)

### 2.1 Active Initiative
- [ ] Check for state file: `_bmad-output/lens-work/state.yaml` (active initiative pointer)
- [ ] Check for initiative configs: `_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/{initiative_id}.yaml`
- [ ] Check for event log: `_bmad-output/lens-work/event-log.jsonl`
- [ ] Detect current phase, track, and branch from active initiative config

### 2.2 Repo Inventory
- [ ] Check for repo inventory: `_bmad-output/lens-work/repo-inventory.yaml`
- [ ] Check TargetProjects path from config

## Step 3: Activate Compass

If preflight passes:
1. Load Compass agent: `_bmad/lens-work/agents/compass.agent.yaml`
2. Display status and available commands
3. Offer: `[onboard]` for new users, `[RS]` to resume, or phase commands

If state exists, show current position:
```
Current Position
  Initiative: {id}
  Track: {track}
  Phase: {phase} (audience: {audience})
  Branch: {branch}
  Next: {recommendation}
```

**Additional Commands:**
- `/switch` — Switch between active initiatives
- `/context` — Display full current context
- `[onboard]` — First-time user onboarding walkthrough

```
