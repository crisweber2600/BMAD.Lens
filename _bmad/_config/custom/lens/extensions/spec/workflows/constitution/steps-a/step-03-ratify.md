# Step 3: Ratify Amendment

Validate and apply the amendment.

---

## Inheritance Validation

**For Add/Modify operations:**

Same validation as create mode:
- Check against parent articles
- Flag contradictions
- Require resolution before proceeding

**For Clarify/Deprecate:**
- No inheritance check needed (doesn't change rule substance)

---

## Impact Assessment

**Check for child constitutions:**

```
🔍 **Impact Assessment**

Checking for child constitutions that may be affected...

{if children found:}
Found {count} child constitution(s):
- {child_path_1} ({child_articles_1} articles)
- {child_path_2} ({child_articles_2} articles)

This amendment may affect inherited governance in these constitutions.

{if no children:}
No child constitutions found. Amendment affects only this layer.
```

## Version Increment

**Calculate new version:**
- Add article: Minor version bump (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- Modify rule: Minor version bump
- Clarify: Patch version bump (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
- Deprecate: Minor version bump

**New version:** `{new_version}`
